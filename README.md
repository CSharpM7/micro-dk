# DK's Barrel Blast

Through dark magic, this keeps DK's spinning kong intact when playing with whatever mod by rerouting `special_lw`'s animation/scripts to Spinning Kong (vanilla `special_hi`), and rerouting Barrel animations/scripts to the various `special_lw` scripts.
Hand Slam down smash hasn't been fully reimplemented from vanilla down special, that `exec` script might be too involved for me to reimplement 1:1.
